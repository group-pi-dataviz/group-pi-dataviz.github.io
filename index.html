                        Contrary to what the name suggests, the Pacific South-East Asia (SEA) region has seen his fair share of conflicts and violence in recent years.
                        This is particularly true in countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, Myanmar and the Philippines,
                        where ongoing conflicts and political instability have led to significant human suffering.
                        The following visualizations aim to shed light on the situation in this region by analyzing data on violent events and fatalities from 2017 to 2024.

                        All other events are considered violent.<br>Based on such definition we can notice how about <strong>58%</strong> of events in the SEA region are of violent nature.
                        <br><br>
                        This is an area of the world that is not talked much about, besides some cases such as Afghanistan.
                        This, however, is one of the most populated regions of the world with countries like Pakistan, Indonesia and Bangladesh with populations in the hundreds of millions
                        and, of course, India with it's 1.4 billion people being the most populated country in the world.

                        This part of the world, however, is very diverse so to get a more precise picture it is better to focus on individual countries
                        rather than considering it as a single identity.

                        The South-East Asia region is very diverse in terms of conflict dynamics, with some countries experiencing high levels of violence while others remain relatively peaceful.
                        <br><br>
                        From the grouped bar chart, we can see that countries like Afghanistan, Pakistan, Myanmar, and the Philippines have a significantly higher number of fatalities compared to other countries in the region.
                        This indicates that these countries are facing more intense and deadly conflicts.
                        <br><br>
                        It is important to note that the number of events does not always correlate directly with the number of fatalities.
                        For example, India has a high number of events but a relatively low number of fatalities compared to countries like Afghanistan and Pakistan.
                        This could be due to various factors such as the type of government, the nature of the events, the effectiveness of security measures, or differences in reporting practices.

                                there have been an open conflict in the country between the Taliban and the Afghan government,
                                supported by international forces led by the United States.

                                In fact, between 2016 and 2022, the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte has launched a controversial anti-drug campaign,
                                which has resulted in thousands of fatalities. Adding to this, there are also ongoing protests and armed conflicts with various insurgent groups in the country.

                            <li>In <strong>Myanmar</strong>, battles are the most common event type, suggesting armed conflicts in recent years.
                                The country has been facing internal conflicts for decades, with various ethnic armed groups fighting for autonomy or independence.
                                Additionally, the military coup in February 2021 has further escalated violence and instability in the country.

                        As we can see from the heatmaps, each country has its own unique pattern of violence over the years.
                        In <strong>Afghanistan</strong> battles and explosions have been the most common event types throughout the years,
                        reaching peaks of almost 10 thousands events in 2018, and declining in the years following.
                        <br><br>
                        In <strong>Myanmar</strong>, battles have also been the most frequent event type, with a significant increase in 2021 following the military coup.
                        Probably this also lead to a steep decrease in riots, which reached 0 in 2024.
                        <br><br>
                        Finally, in the <strong>Philippines</strong>, violence against civilians has been the most common event type, with a peak in 2016-2017 likely due to the anti-drug campaign launched by President Duterte.

                        This can be attributed to the withdrawal of international forces and the subsequent takeover by the Taliban in August 2021,
                        which has led to a significant reduction in large scale armed conflicts.
                        While this has resulted in fewer fatalities from battles, it is not necessarily indicative of an improving situation.

                        Like many conflict zones, Afghanistan has experienced fluctuations in violence throughout the year.
                        The histogram shows a clear seasonal pattern in the occurrence of violent events, with peaks typically observed during the warmer months.
                        This trend can be attributed to several factors, including improved weather conditions that facilitate movement and operations for various armed groups,
                        as well as the traditional fighting season in Afghanistan, which often coincides with the spring and summer months.
